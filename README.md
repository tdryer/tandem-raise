Tandem Raise GNOME Shell Extension
==================================

This [GNOME Shell][1] extension makes raising (focusing) one window that is
tiled together with a sibling window also raise the sibling window. The effect
is that if one of the siblings is focused, neither window will be obscured.

This restores behaviour that was [removed in GNOME 3.28][2].

Get it on [GNOME Extensions][3].
